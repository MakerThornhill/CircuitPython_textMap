# What it does
Memory-conserving text graphics handling for CircuitPython, including colored text boxes.

# Usage

    import textmap
    from textmap import textBox

This set of text display routines attempts to overcome the large memory usage of the current "label" function in the CircuitPython Display_Text library.  That function uses a collection of tileGrid (one per character) to handle printing proportional fonts.  The tileGrid approach comes with a lot of overhead that may be useful or unnecessary depending upon your application.

This `textmap` library attempts to reduce memory usage by letting you provide a bitmap where the text is written.

This library consists of two generic functions for writing text to the screen and then an example class `textBox` with capabilities for handling cursor position and inserting text.

### Key Basic Functions
- `placeText` - Add the text to a bitmap
- `bounding_box` - If I want to print some text, how large of a box is required to fit it?


Example Class `textBox` - Creates a bitmap and handles cursor position, adding text and clearing the box. The functions handle word wrapping.

### Class Functions: `textBox` 
- `addText` - Add some text to the box at the current cursor position
- `setCursor` - Change the cursor (x,y) position
- `getCursor` - Returns the cursor (x,y) position
- `clearBitmap` - Clears the textBox bitmap to the original background color


# Key Basic Functions
The `placeText` function transfers text into a bitmap at the specified x and y locations.  For this function, you provide a `bitmap`, the `text`, `font` and `lineSpacing` and `x` and `y` locations for text to be added.  This functions writes the text into your bitmap.

The `bounding_box` function is used to determine how large of a box (x and y) is required to cover the prospective text that you want to write.  This function is useful to calculate if a proposed text string will fit where you want to put it.  That way, you can determine if the text will fit before you write it.  This is particularly useful for word-wrapping or text-wrapping in a text terminal window.

Note: Currently, the builtinFont `terminalio.FONT` is not handled with these functions.  (Reason: The terminalio.FONT builtinFont class is a fixed-sized font and its class is defined a little bit differently than an imported BDF font.)

# Example Class: textBox

The `textBox` example class provides a few structures and methods for creating and handling text addition into a rectangular box.  The `textBox` consists of a bitmap (`length`, `width`, `backGroundColor`), along with the required parameters to define the text that is to be added 
(`font`, `textColor`, `lineSpacing`).

The `textBox` class includes several functions for adding text (`addText`), setting and getting the cursor position (`setCursor` and `getCursor`) and clearing the bitmap (`clearBitMap`).

Once you instance a `textBox`, you can then add the `textBoxName.bitmap` into a tileGrid for further displaying on an attached display.

# SimpleTest examples:

Two example files are included.  The file 'textmap_simpletest_builtin_screen.py' is setup for use with the Adafruit style boards with builtin screens, since the display startup is pretty simple.  The other file `textmap_simpletest.py` adds the more complicated setup for any other SPI connected displays.  You may need to update the SPI settings and the display driver for your particular display board.

The example files create four textBox instances and plots them to the screen. This example uses the three fonts that can be found in the `fonts` subdirectory.

Each time through the while loop, one character is added to the `textBox`.  Whenever the full string has been written, the `textBox` is cleared and text writing begins again.  One of the boxes is stationary, while the other three are then moved around on the screen. 

On the Adafruit ItsyBitsy NRF52840 board, I see 68800 bytes of memory free, enough room to add another font or two!
